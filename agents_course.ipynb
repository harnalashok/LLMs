        "\n",
        "To explain what an Agent is, let's start with an analogy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Big Picture: Alfred The Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "Meet Alfred. Alfred is an **Agent**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine Alfred **receives a command**, such as: \"Alfred, I would like a coffee please.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Because Alfred **understands natural language**, he quickly grasps our request.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before fulfilling the order, Alfred engages in **reasoning and planning**, figuring out the steps and tools he needs to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Go to the kitchen  \n",
        "2. Use the coffee machine  \n",
        "3. Brew the coffee  \n",
        "4. Bring the coffee back\n",
        "\n",
        "Once he has a plan, he **must act**. To execute his plan, **he can use tools from the list of tools he knows about**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, to make a coffee, he uses a coffee machine. He activates the coffee machine to brew the coffee.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, Alfred brings the freshly brewed coffee to us.\n",
        "\n",
        "And this is what an Agent is: an **AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment**.\n",
        "\n",
        "We call it Agent because it has _agency_, aka it has the ability to interact with the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Let's go more formal\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have the big picture, here’s a more precise definition:\n",
        "\n",
        "> An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of the Agent as having two main parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Brain (AI Model)**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model **handles reasoning and planning**.\n",
        "It decides **which Actions to take based on the situation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The Body (Capabilities and Tools)**\n",
        "\n",
        "This part represents **everything the Agent is equipped to do**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **scope of possible actions** depends on what the agent **has been equipped with**. For example, because humans lack wings, they can't perform the \"fly\" **Action**, but they can execute **Actions** like \"walk\", \"run\" ,\"jump\", \"grab\", and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The spectrum of \"Agency\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Following this definition, Agents exist on a continuous spectrum of increasing agency:\n",

        "## What type of AI Models do we use for Agents?\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common AI model found in Agents is an LLM (Large Language Model), which  takes **Text** as an input and outputs **Text** as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well known examples are **GPT4** from **OpenAI**, **LLama** from **Meta**, **Gemini** from **Google**, etc. These models have been trained on a vast amount of text and are able to generalize well. We will learn more about LLMs in the [next section](what-are-llms).\n",
        "\n",
        "> [!TIP]\n",
        "> It's also possible to use models that accept other inputs as the Agent's core model. For example, a Vision Language Model (VLM), which is like an LLM but also understands images as input. We'll focus on LLMs for now and will discuss other options later.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How does an AI take action on its environment?\n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs are amazing models, but **they can only generate text**.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if you ask a well-known chat application like HuggingChat or ChatGPT to generate an image, they can! How is that possible?\n",
        "\n",
        "The answer is that the developers of HuggingChat, ChatGPT and similar apps implemented additional functionality (called **Tools**), that the LLM can use to create images.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model used an Image Generation Tool to generate this image.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will learn more about tools in the [Tools](tools) section.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What type of tasks can an Agent do?\n",
        "\n",
        "An Agent can perform any task we implement via **Tools** to complete **Actions**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if I write an Agent to act as my personal assistant (like Siri) on my computer, and I ask it to \"send an email to my Manager asking to delay today's meeting\", I can give it some code to send emails. This will be a new Tool the Agent can use whenever it needs to send an email. We can write it in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def send_message_to(recipient, message):\n",
        "    \"\"\"Useful to send an e-mail message to a recipient\"\"\"\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM, as we'll see, will generate code to run the tool when it needs to, and thus fulfill the desired task.\n",

        "```python\n",
        "send_message_to(\"Manager\", \"Can we postpone today's meeting?\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The **design of the Tools is very important and has a great impact on the quality of your Agent**. Some tasks will require very specific Tools to be crafted, while others may be solved with general purpose tools like \"web_search\".\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note that **Actions are not the same as Tools**. An Action, for instance, can involve the use of multiple Tools to complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "Allowing an agent to interact with its environment **allows real-life usage for companies and individuals**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 1: Personal Virtual Assistants\n",
        "\n",
        "Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, work as agents when they interact on behalf of users using their digital environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "They take user queries, analyze context, retrieve information from databases, and provide responses or initiate actions (like setting reminders, sending messages, or controlling smart devices).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 2: Customer Service Chatbots\n",
        "\n",
        "Many companies deploy chatbots as agents that interact with customers in natural language.\n",
        "\n",
        "These agents can answer questions, guide users through troubleshooting steps, open issues in internal databases, or even complete transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Their predefined objectives might include improving user satisfaction, reducing wait times, or increasing sales conversion rates. By interacting directly with customers, learning from the dialogues, and adapting their responses over time, they demonstrate the core principles of an agent in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example 3: AI Non-Playable Character in a video game\n",
        "\n",
        "AI agents powered by LLMs can make Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) more dynamic and unpredictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of following rigid behavior trees, they can **respond contextually, adapt to player interactions**, and generate more nuanced dialogue. This flexibility helps create more lifelike, engaging characters that evolve alongside the player’s actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, an Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Understand natural language:**  Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reason and plan:** Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "Most LLMs nowadays are **built on the Transformer architecture**—a deep learning architecture based on the \"Attention\" algorithm, that has gained significant interest since the release of BERT from Google in 2018.\n",

        "\n",
        "While the full process can be quite technical for the purpose of learning agents, here's a brief overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Once the input text is **tokenized**, the model computes a representation of the sequence that captures information about the meaning and the position of each token in the input sequence.\n",
        "- This representation goes into the model, which outputs scores that rank the likelihood of each token in its vocabulary as being the next one in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these scores, we have multiple strategies to select the tokens to complete the sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The easiest decoding strategy would be to always take the token with the maximum score.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can interact with the decoding process yourself with SmolLM2 in this Space (remember, it decodes until reaching an **EOS** token which is  **** for this model):\n",
        "\n",
        "- But there are more advanced decoding strategies. For example, *beam search* explores multiple candidate sequences to find the one with the maximum total score–even if some individual tokens have lower scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to know more about decoding, you can take a look at the [NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Attention is all you need\n",
        "\n",
        "A key aspect of the Transformer architecture is **Attention**. When predicting the next word,\n",
        "not every word in a sentence is equally important; words like \"France\" and \"capital\" in the sentence *\"The capital of France is ...\"* carry the most meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process of identifying the most relevant words to predict the next token has proven to be incredibly effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the basic principle of LLMs—predicting the next token—has remained consistent since GPT-2, there have been significant advancements in scaling neural networks and making the attention mechanism work for longer and longer sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you've interacted with LLMs, you're probably familiar with the term *context length*, which refers to the maximum number of tokens the LLM can process, and the maximum _attention span_ it has.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prompting the LLM is important\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering that the only job of an LLM is to predict the next token by looking at every input token, and to choose which tokens are \"important\", the wording of your input sequence is very important.\n",
        "\n",

        "## How are LLMs trained?\n",

        "\n",
        "From this unsupervised learning, the model learns the structure of the language and **underlying patterns in text, allowing the model to generalize to unseen data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "After this initial _pre-training_, LLMs can be fine-tuned on a supervised learning objective to perform specific tasks. For example, some models are trained for conversational structures or tool usage, while others focus on classification or code generation.\n",
