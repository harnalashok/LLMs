# Postgres notes:  
# Last amended: 25th July, 2025  

Concepts
=========
       1. psql Prompt:
       A standard prompt is displayed when psql is ready to accept a new SQL command
       or meta-command. By default, it often shows the database name followed by => 
       for regular users or # for superusers (e.g., mydatabase=> or postgres=#). 
       List all databases with \l command.

       2. System users and postgres users:
       The root user is an account on the system independent from Postgres. There is 
       only ONE root user. A superuser is an account in Postgres with access to 
       everything. There may be MANY superusers. System accounts and Postgres 
       accounts are different things, although unless you specify a Postgres username
       when you connect to the database (through utilities like psql, createdb, dropdb,
       or otherwise), it will use the current system user's name in hopes that there is
       a corresponding Postgres account with the same name. The root user does not, 
       by default, have a corresponding account in Postgres. When you install Postgres 
       on *nix, it creates both a superuser named postgres and a system user named postgres.
       Therefore, when you need to do something with Postgres as the built-in superuser, 
       you have two options:

               a. You may sudo su - postgres to become the postgres system user and 
                  execute your command (createdb, psql, etc). Because the system user
                  has the same name as the database superuser, your command will 
                  connect as the appropriate account.
    	       b. You may specify the username to execute as with the -U switch, eg
                  psql -U postgres   

        To list all 'superusers', issue command: \du

        3. Postgres has, by default, a database 'postgres' and a superuser 'postgres'.
	A superuser in PostgreSQL is a user who bypasses all permission checks. 
	This user can do anything. The prompt:
	
	               postgres=# 
	
	indicates that the database is postgres and the '#' symbol indicates that the logged
	in role is the superuser, 'postgres'.
	You can change the logged in role with the command: 'Set Role muyser ;' and, the prompt
        will change. 'Set Role' DOES NOT change connected database:
	
		postgres=# set role myuser ;
		postgres=> create database xyz ;              -- Role changed; prompt changes. Database still 'postgres'
		ERROR:  permission denied to create database  --'myuser' be first given privilegs by superuser
                                                              	
	Set the role back to superuser, and as superuser, create a database and grant ownership to
	myuser:
	
		postgres=> set role postgres ;

	4. To create a database and a user, first loginto system user (and NOT postgres user) postgres :

		ashok@ashok:~$ sudo su postgres
           
            Then, open psql:

                postgres@ashok:~$ psql

            This command assumes that postgres has a role with the same name as the current user *ie postgres)
            and tries to log you in (else, issue command: psql ashok --- to login a user ashok). Prompt is:

		postgres=# 
	
	5. Create a user and create a database, as:

		postgres=# create user joker with password 'joker' ;
		postgres=# CREATE DATABASE joker ;
		postgres=# CREATE DATABASE king with owner ashok ; 
		postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE joker TO ashok; 
        
	6. A postgres user, say, 'joker' cannot log into postgres with psql unless, joker, is also a system user.
	   Thus, this command fails:

		ashok@ashok:~$ psql -U joker -d 'joker' ;
	
	7. Login as, postgres user and change role to joker, as:

		sudo su postgres
		psql -U postgres
		postgres=# set role joker ;
		postgres=> 
		# Connect to joker database
		postgres=> \c joker
		You are now connected to database "joker" as user "postgres".
		joker=# 
		# Create a table:
		joker=# CREATE TABLE product (
                        id           char(5) primary key,
                        name         varchar(20),      
                        price        real,             
                        qty          integer,          
                        purchased    boolean,          -- true or false
                        feedback     text 
                    );
		CREATE TABLE
		# Insert values
		joker=# INSERT INTO product (id, name, price) VALUES ('01121', 'Mustang', 60.4);
		joker=# select * from product ;
		# Table with constraints:
		joker=# CREATE TABLE employees (
		    				employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
		    				first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		    				last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		    				email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
		    				hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
						);
	8. Foreign key:
		joker=# drop table departments ;
		DROP TABLE
		joker=# drop table employees ;
		DROP TABLE
		joker=# CREATE TABLE departments (
		    department_id int PRIMARY KEY,
		    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
		);
		CREATE TABLE
		joker=# CREATE TABLE employees (
		    employee_id int PRIMARY KEY,
		    employee_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		    departmentId INT REFERENCES departments (department_id)
		    );
		CREATE TABLE
		joker=# 

		joker=# INSERT INTO departments (department_id,department_name)
		VALUES (1, 'Human Resources'), (10,'Finance'), (20,'IT');
		INSERT 0 3
		joker=# INSERT INTO employees (employee_id,employee_name, departmentId) values (1,'Alice', 10);
		INSERT 0 1
		joker=# INSERT INTO employees (employee_id,employee_name, departmentId) values (2,'Bob', 10);
		INSERT 0 1
		joker=# INSERT INTO employees (employee_id,employee_name, departmentId) values (3,'sudha', 20);
		INSERT 0 1
		joker=# INSERT INTO employees (employee_id,employee_name, departmentId) values (4,'Charlie', 3);
		ERROR:  insert or update on table "employees" violates foreign key constraint "employees_departmentid_fkey"
		DETAIL:  Key (departmentid)=(3) is not present in table "departments".
		joker=# 





	Schemas in postgresql:

In PostgreSQL, a schema is a named collection or logical grouping of database objects within a single database. These objects can include tables, views, functions, sequences, indexes, and data types. Schemas serve as namespaces, allowing for the organization and management of database objects.
Key aspects of PostgreSQL schemas:

    Organization:
    Schemas provide a way to logically group related database objects, making complex databases more manageable and easier to understand. For instance, you could have separate schemas for different applications, departments, or functional areas within the same database (e.g., sales, hr, ecommerce).

Namespacing:
Schemas create distinct namespaces. This means that objects with the same name can exist in different schemas without causing conflicts. For example, you could have a users table in a public schema and another users table in an auth schema, referenced as public.users and auth.users respectively. 
Access Control:
Schemas can be used to manage permissions and access control. You can grant or revoke privileges on specific schemas or the objects within them to different users or roles, enhancing security and data isolation.
Default Schema:
Every new PostgreSQL database automatically includes a public schema, which is the default schema for creating objects if no specific schema is mentioned.
Schema Search Path:
PostgreSQL uses a search_path to determine the order in which schemas are checked when an object is referenced without a fully qualified name (e.g., just users instead of public.users). The default search path typically includes $user (the schema named after the current user) and public. This path can be customized.






		

CREATE DATABASE dbname OWNER rolename;

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE mydatabase WITH OWNER = myuser;
		CREATE DATABASE
	
	IF 'myuser' wants to create a table, he has to proceed as follows. First connect to
	the database, mydatabase:
	
		postgres=# \c mydatabase
		You are now connected to database "mydatabase" as user "postgres".
		mydatabase=#
	
	Connected to database, mydatabase, but the logged in role is still the superuser. If
	any table is created, it will be created by the superuser within this database. Remember,
	the superuser can bypass all permission checks.
	
		postgres=# \c mydatabase
		You are now connected to database "mydatabase" as user "postgres".
		mydatabase=# create table n8n (id integer) ;
		CREATE TABLE
		mydatabase=# \dt
		        List of relations
		 Schema | Name | Type  |  Owner
		--------+------+-------+----------
		 public | n8n  | table | postgres
		(1 row)
	
	Thus, the user, myuser, has no authority over the table n8n. There are two ways, myuser
	can have a table:

		I. Superuser grants all privileges over the table.
		II. The user logs in as 'myuser' and creates a table.
	
	Here we follow the IInd route:
	
		mydatabase=# set role myuser ;
		SET
		mydatabase=> create table axr (id char(5)) ;   
		CREATE TABLE
		mydatabase=> \dt             --Check ownership
		        List of relations
		 Schema | Name | Type  |  Owner
		--------+------+-------+----------
		 public | axr  | table | myuser
		 public | n8n  | table | postgres
		(2 rows)

	To find out the current logged in role, issue command 'select current_user'

		mydatabase=> select user ;    -- OR current_user
		 current_user
		--------------
		 myuser
		(1 row)

	A quick summary:
		postgres=# 		        -- Database postgres. Role postgres
		db_amit=# 			-- Database  db_amit. Role postgers
		db_amit=> 			-- Database  db_amit. Role amit

#	and NOT postgres user:
 
 	\c mydatabase
 	set role myuser ;
 	create table n8x (id integer) ;
 	
#7. Check tables created by user 'myuser'
#   Command is \dt

	\dt


#8. Quickatart-1: 
# Create user ashok, database ashok and password: ashok, as:
	sudo -u postgres psql -c 'create database ashok;'
	sudo -u postgres psql -c 'create user ashok;'
	sudo -u postgres psql -c 'grant all privileges on database ashok to ashok;'

	create table n8n (id char(5) primary key, name varchar(20), qty real, tourist boolean, ht integer) ; --  role joker
        \d n8n                                  -- describe table structure of 'n8n'
	\dt      			        -- Displaty list of all tables


#11. Create table sample:

CREATE TABLE product (
    			id           char(5) primary key,
			name         varchar(20),           -- low temperature
			price        real,           -- high temperature
