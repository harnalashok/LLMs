Pyhton Virtual Environments
============================

Virtual environments in python can be created using conda, uv or simply python.
Virtual environments are directories that contain all necessary python packages
to work on a project. Simple python command to create a virtual environment is:

          python3 -m venv /path/to/package/name

For example, the python, 'venv' command would create the
environment at the following location:

          python3 -m venv path/to/package/name

  will create a folder at:
  
          /home/ashok/path/to/package/name/

And all python packages would be installed thereon. You can activate the 
virtual environment, as:

        source /path/to/package/name/bin/activate

And deactivate it, with simple command:

          deactivate

          ashok@ashok:~$  python3 -m venv path/to/package/name

You can explore what is under name/ folder, as:

          ashok@ashok:~$ ls -la ~/path/to/package/name/
          total 24
          drwxr-xr-x 5 ashok ashok 4096 Jan 26 13:40 .
          drwxr-xr-x 3 ashok ashok 4096 Jan 26 13:40 ..
          drwxr-xr-x 2 ashok ashok 4096 Jan 26 13:40 bin
          drwxr-xr-x 2 ashok ashok 4096 Jan 26 13:40 include
          drwxr-xr-x 3 ashok ashok 4096 Jan 26 13:40 lib
          lrwxrwxrwx 1 ashok ashok    3 Jan 26 13:40 lib64 -> lib
          -rw-r--r-- 1 ashok ashok   71 Jan 26 13:40 pyvenv.cfg

And here is the content of .cfg file.

          ashok@ashok:~$ cat ~/path/to/package/name/pyvenv.cfg
          home = /usr/bin
          include-system-site-packages = false
          version = 3.10.12

uv
======
Ref: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#using-a-virtual-environment
++++++
uv also creates python environment, as:

          uv venv 

A specific name or path can be specified, e.g., to create a virtual environment 
at my-name:

          uv venv my-name

Unlike pip , uv requires using a virtual environment by default.

This creates a python environment at folder .venv under the current path.
You can specify the location, as:

          ashok@ashok:~$ uv venv ~/abc/def/hjk
          Using CPython 3.10.12 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python3
          Creating virtual environment at: abc/def/hjk
          Activate with: source abc/def/hjk/bin/activate

By default, each time the command, 'uv venv' is executed, earlier default
python environment is deleted. This default behaviour, however, can be changed. 
See:

          uv help venv

When using the default virtual environment name, uv will automatically find and 
use the virtual environment during subsequent invocations.

          uv venv
          # Install a package in the new virtual environment
          uv pip install ruff
uv pip install, behind the scenes activates the environment, installs pip package
and then deactivates it. There is no need to deactivate the environment when using uv.

You can also explicitly activate a uv evironment,as:

          source .venv/bin/activate

When running a command that mutates an environment such as uv pip sync or uv pip install,
uv will search for a virtual environment in the following order:

    i)   An activated virtual environment based on the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable.
    ii)  An activated Conda environment based on the CONDA_PREFIX environment variable.
    iii) A virtual environment at .venv in the current directory, or in the nearest parent directory.

If no virtual environment is found, uv will prompt the user to create one in the current directory 
via 'uv venv'.

List all python environments
===========================
You can list all python environment under the home folder, as:

          find ~ | grep /bin/activate

Here is an example:

          ashok@ashok:~$ find ~ | grep /bin/activate
          /home/ashok/path/to/package/name/bin/activate.csh
          /home/ashok/path/to/package/name/bin/activate.fish
          /home/ashok/path/to/package/name/bin/activate
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate.nu
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate.csh
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate.fish
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate.ps1
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate_this.py
          /home/ashok/.venv/bin/activate.bat
          /home/ashok/llama/bin/activate.csh
          /home/ashok/llama/bin/activate.fish
          /home/ashok/llama/bin/activate
