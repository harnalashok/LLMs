            "The methodology presented in the paper involves a novel framework called MIMO for controllable character video synthesis. The framework decomposes a 2D video into three spatial components: the main human, the underlying scene, and floating occlusions, using hierarchical layers based on 3D depth. These components are then encoded into canonical identity code, structured motion code, and full scene code, which serve as control signals for the synthesis process. The structured motion code is derived from a deformable human body model (SMPL) and camera parameters, enabling more dense pose representation with 3D occlusions. The canonical identity code is obtained by transforming the posed human image to a canonical result in standard A-pose using a pretrained human repose model. The scene and occlusion components are embedded with a shared VAE encoder and re-organized as a full scene code. These latent codes are inserted into a diffusion-based decoder as conditions for video reconstruction. The network is trained using a diffusion noise-prediction loss, with the denoising U-Net and reference-net initialized with pretrained weights from Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5, and the motion module initialized with weights from AnimateDiff. The training is conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for around 50k iterations with 24 video frames and a batch size of 4.\n"
